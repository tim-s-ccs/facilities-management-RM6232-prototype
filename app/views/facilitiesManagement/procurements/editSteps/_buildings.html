          When creating your buildings, you are not restricted to create just full buildings, for example you may choose to set up just a floor or a specific area within a building. You may also set up an external area, such as a park, as a ‘building’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your service pricing will be broken down to show a cost per service per ‘building’, allowing you to manage your contract effectively. You should therefore create ‘buildings’ dependent on the level of detail you require.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a site, campus, group of buildings, these should be set up individually and not grouped together into one site.
