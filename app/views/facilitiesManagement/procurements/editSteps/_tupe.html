    TUPE, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) protects the rights of employees when the business or commercial contract that they are working on changes to new ownership.<br>
    It ensures that employees who find themselves transferred to a new business, retain exactly the same hours and rate of pay as they were contracted to with the old employer.

      When a supplier changes, the original service providerâ€™s workers may be protected under TUPE.<br>
      For example, a new supplier is awarded the contract to provide cleaning services to a building.<br>
      The cleaners, who are employed by the current service provider, may be protected under TUPE.
